<p>The <a href="https://www.pasafarming.org">Pennsylvania Association of Sustainable Agriculture</a> (PASA) sponsored a field day on June 2 to talk about growing vegetables in a changing climate.  The discussion focused on climate change, its impacts on the farming system, and strategies to effectively adapt through increasing biodiversity on the farm.</p>
<p>PASA?s Director of Educational Programs, Franklin Egan, provided an overview of climate change trends and projections.  Dave King and others who farm 160 acres of vegetables and small fruit all sold within 25 miles of the farm, talked about their challenges and sustainable farming practices.  Among them, high tunnel beds have more aphids and pill bugs in the winter, downy mildew appears earlier in the summer, weeds are not any easier to manage especially without degrading soil health,  irrigation costs are rising, and deer pressure rises during droughts.  Practices being continuously adapted to respond to changing conditions include a highly diversified crop production system, use of beneficial insects, crop rotations, cover cropping, and rye straw mulch.<span id="more-65390"></span></p>
<p>Several guest speakers contributed their expertise to the program, including John R. Taylor, Ph.D., Assistant Professor of Sustainable Agroecology at Chatham University, Lee Stivers, Penn State Extension Educator in Horticulture and Heather Manzo, Penn State Extension Educator in Ag Entrepreneurship &amp; Community Economic Development.  Taylor used an ecological framework to present how different practices increase biodiversity within the larger landscape.  Building off of this, Stivers provided an overview of soil health and the win-win role cover crops, crop rotation and crop diversification play in both improving soil quality and removing carbon from the air.  Finally the day concluded with a presentation by Manzo on the many resources available from USDA agencies to protect the fiscal sustainability of the farm including crop insurance, NRCS conservation programs, FSA loan programs and many more.</p>
<p>Knowledge exchanged between scientists, educators and farmers facing the reality of climate change is essential to developing practical climate adaptation and greenhouse gas mitigation solutions.  PASA?s proactive effort brings resources together to confront the challenges of climate change and keeps its members profitable at producing healthy food while respecting the natural environment.  Funding for the Field Day, webinars, a pre-conference track at the recent 25th annual Farming for the Future conference, and a four part series of articles in the association?s newsletter <em>Passages</em> was supported by an EPA Environmental Justice grant (#96335501) for educational programs related to climate change and agriculture, and by the USDA Northeast Climate Hub.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 510px"><img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7303/27245428714_9e2463497e.jpg" alt="Farmers Scott and Susan Hill in front of their pollinator garden" width="500" height="467" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Farmers Scott and Susan Hill in front of their pollinator garden. ?We had an agricultural specialist visit our farm operations who told us we needed more pollinators,? explained Susan Hill. ?We initially added two bee hives and established a pollinator garden.

<p>Since it?s National Pollinator Week, it seemed fitting to express my thanks to farmers Scott and Susan Hill &#8211; who run the Hill Farm outside Charlottesville, VA.  Earlier, I had the chance to visit their 10-acre property former tobacco farm to see firsthand how hard they are working to grow a variety of produce for the local customers. But there are more little workers helping on the Hill Farm too. Pollinators!</p>
<p>In the United States, about one third of all agricultural output depends on pollinators. Insects and other animal pollinators are vital to the production of healthy crops for food, fibers, edible oils, medicines, and other products. It?s clear that pollinators are important to the Hill Farm for their production of their artisan and specialty varieties of several vegetables, including lettuce, asparagus, tomatoes and even golden beets.  And the first year, the addition of bees increased their tomato production by 25 percent.<span id="more-65385"></span></p>
<p>The commodities produced with the help of pollinators generate significant income for agricultural producers and those who benefit from a productive agricultural community. An estimated $15 billion worth of crops, including more than 90 fruits and vegetables are pollinated by honey bees alone. Pollinators are also essential components of the habitats and ecosystems that many wild animals rely on for food and shelter.</p>
<p>You may have heard that in recent years pollinators have experienced in serious decline in their population. Helping pollinators is critical to healthy food systems and native ecosystems since virtually all of the world?s seed plants need to be pollinated. Here at USDA, we are working to promote pollinator health as part of White House Pollinator Health Task Force?s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/Pollinator%20Health%20Strategy%202015.pdf">National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators</a>.</p>
<p>One particular project involves USDA?s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/site_main.htm?modecode=80-42-05-40">Bee Research Laboratory</a>, which is focused on improving honey bee survival. ARS conducts research on bees and provides science-based beekeeping and management strategies to help bee keepers across the country build and maintain healthy honey bee populations. ARS is also organizing a national bee gene bank that will help preserve the genetic diversity of honey bees, especially for traits such as resistance to pests or diseases and pollination efficiency.</p>
<p>The National Agricultural Statistics Service recently issued the first Honey Bee Colonies Report that provides information about honey bee losses. The report is an important tool to better understand honey bee population dynamics. The National Institute of Food and Agriculture set a priority for pollinator health for their grant program that provides funding that address key problems in sustaining all components of food and agriculture.</p>
<p>ARS along with the Farm Service Agency and the National Resource Conservation Service are working with U.S. Geological Survey to monitor honeybee colonies in four states to evaluate the effectiveness conservation programs to enhance pollinator forage habitat and hive health.</p>
<p>This work by USDA is increasing our understanding of pollinators, their needs, and the threats to their health. In fact, Secretary Tom Vilsack signed a National Pollinator Week proclamation stating ?pollinators such as honey bees, native bees, birds, bats, and butterflies contribute substantially to the economy of the United States and are vital to keeping fruits, nuts, and vegetables in our diets.?</p>
<p>USDA will be celebrating National Pollinator Week in the People?s Garden and USDA?s Farmers Market, managed <a href="https://www.ams.usda.gov/">USDA?s Agricultural Marketing Service</a>.  Join us on Friday, June 24, from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., to learn about bees, birds, bats and other pollinating animals at the sixth annual Pollinator Festival outside USDA Headquarters along 12th Street in Washington, DC. More than 14 USDA agencies, other federal departments and partners will celebrate the significance of pollinators.</p>

<p><em>This post is part of the <a href="http://blogs.usda.gov/tag/science-tuesday/">Science Tuesday</a> feature series on the USDA blog. Check back each week as we showcase stories and news from USDA?s rich science and research portfolio.</em></p>
<p><em></em>The goal of USDA?s Hispanic-Serving Institutions National Program (HSINP) Future Scientists Program is to enhance the scientific knowledge of teachers, helping them to become more effective in encouraging student interest and progress in science. Teachers in the program attend two-day summer institutes at Agricultural Research Service (ARS) labs nationwide, where scientists introduce them to various research projects. ARS researchers share scientific knowledge with the teachers, who then share it with their students to encourage them to become future scientists.</p>
<p>One of the catalysts for this lofty goal is a tiny, inconspicuous and innocuous caterpillar?the corn earworm that wreaks havoc in corn fields nationwide as an agricultural pest.  This program began in 2003.  I brought 10 teachers into the ARS Southern Plains Agricultural Research Center (SPARC) in College Station, Texas, for a summer institute that included teachers studying in corn research plots searching for corn earworm caterpillars in 100-degree heat! It was the first time I made caterpillars the focus of this program.<span id="more-65282"></span></p>
<p>Since then, the program has expanded to include students visiting various ARS research labs. I have also harnessed the caterpillar?s ?intrigue factor,? since students are intrigued<em> </em>by insects.  They are intrigued by the magic of metamorphosis?particularly when the caterpillar transforms into a beautiful moth.  They are intrigued that they can learn by observation.  They are intrigued enough to ask questions about the worm and then conduct research projects to find answers. The ARS Southeast Area insectary in Stoneville, Mississippi, generously supplies the program with all the worms we need.</p>
<p>Students conduct research on the worms and then make presentations at the end of their school year at their local ARS lab at a Future Scientists Student Research Presentation Day. They also take tours and learn about other research projects at the labs.</p>
<p>One student who presented in 2004 subsequently became a student summer worker at SPARC while in high school, continued working while studying entomology at junior college, and has just received a scholarship to attend Texas A&amp;M University.</p>
<p>This year, his teacher brought four of her current fifth-graders to present their research on the worm.  These are just four of the 86,000 students (grades K through 12) whom we have interacted with in the past 21 years of the Future Scientist Program. During that time, 5,600 teachers have studied Ag Science at 36 of the ARS labs nationwide.</p>

<p>Over the past three years, USDA has welcomed seventh-graders from Alice Deal Middle School in Washington, D.C. to participate in ?Deal Gives Back,? a day of service that empowers students to serve their community. This year was no exception. Alongside local volunteers, 118 students and faculty spent a day at USDA?s People?s Garden planting, weeding, and tilling soil to better understand how community gardens can increase access to fresh, healthy food choices in communities where nutritious options aren?t easily accessible.</p>
<p>All work and no play? Not a chance. After a warm welcome from USDA Assistant Secretary for Administration Dr. Gregory Parham, the students checked out demonstrations from the Agricultural Research Services? (ARS) <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/site_main.htm?modecode=80-42-05-40" target="_blank">Bee Research</a> and <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/main/site_main.htm?modecode=80-42-05-80">Systematic Etymology</a> Labs to learn about insect classification, research, and the vital role pollinators play in growing healthy fruits and vegetables. And to wrap up the day, National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) Director Dr. Sonny Ramaswamy stopped by with a surprise treat ? an invitation to try toasted mealworms. Yum!<span id="more-65274"></span></p>
<p>Events like ?Deal Gives Back? allow young people to enjoy the outdoors, learn where their food comes from and see firsthand the role agriculture plays in their day-to-day lives in both rural and urban communities, including our nation?s capital, Washington D.C.</p>

<p>You probably know that climate change affects how we grow food, but you might not know that how food is grown also affects our climate. This interplay is at the heart of an Agricultural Research Service (ARS) project called ?Soil and Air,? a concerted effort to feed the Earth?s 7.5 billion people while protecting the planet.</p>
<p>Farmers and ranchers produce food at the intersection of soil and air, which in turn impacts soil and air quality. For instance, warmer air creates warmer soil, leading to different compositions of bacteria and other microbes in the ecosystem and to increased moisture loss through evaporation.<span id="more-65115"></span></p>
<p>Soils can also act as a ?sink? by storing excess carbon from the atmosphere and, in turn, improving the soil?s ability to maintain moisture and nutrients. The same is true of air. When a farmer adds crop nutrients, some of those nutrients are oxidized and lost into the air, increasing greenhouse gas levels. More greenhouse gases mean an overall warmer climate, more variable weather, and an increased likelihood of extreme weather.</p>
<p>At ARS locations across the country, scientists are working to improve the relationship between agriculture and our soil and air resources. One group of ARS scientists in Temple, Texas, is optimizing the application of nitrogen fertilizers to several types of crops. When applied to the soil, nitrogen is a crucial additive that promotes plant growth. When that same nitrogen escapes from the soil, it becomes nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas.</p>
<p>While naturally present in the atmosphere, nitrous oxide absorbs the sun?s heat. Too much of it raises global temperatures. The group in Temple is searching for the optimal time to apply nitrogen so that it benefits plants without increasing greenhouse gases. The scientists have developed a test that allows growers to determine how much and when to add nitrogen to the soil.</p>
<p>Another ARS group, in Pullman, Washington, has discovered soil bacteria that act as a nonchemical herbicide for invasive grass species like cheat grass. These invasives choke out native grasses that provide wildlife habitats, increasing the risk of wildfires. In Pacific Northwest crop lands, they reduce yields and impact soil health. The discovered bacteria can nearly eliminate these invasive grasses within five years, and without harming local cereal crops or native grasses. The Environmental Protection Agency has already registered one as a natural herbicide.</p>
<p>Other ARS soil and air scientists are working on management practices such as cover cropping, reduced tillage, and the storage, treatment and use of nutrient-rich animal manure. By exploring management opportunities in these areas, ARS scientists are helping farmers and ranchers improve soil health and air (and water) quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>These are prime examples of how ARS scientists are helping meet the needs of a fast-growing population while keeping the environment clean and livable.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just over a year ago, President Obama released a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/03/27/fact-sheet-obama-administration-releases-national-action-plan-combat-ant">National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria</a>. As part of that plan, he also charged the Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) with co-chairing a Presidential Advisory Council on Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (Advisory Council). In the past year, our three agencies and the Council have held numerous stakeholder meetings, made new discoveries, and undertaken new research to preserve the effectiveness of antibiotics.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, our three agencies have made some important discoveries regarding antibiotic resistance in the United States. Earlier this week, the Department of Defense notified stakeholders that its Multidrug-resistant Organism Repository and Surveillance Network (MRSN) at the Walter Reed Institute of Research had identified the first colistin-resistant <em>mcr-1</em> <em>E. coli</em> in a person in the United States. A USDA and HHS search for colistin-resistant bacteria in food animals, retail meats and people also has found colistin-resistant <em>E. coli</em> in a single sample from a pig intestine.<span id="more-65075"></span></p>
<p>These discoveries are of concern because colistin is used as a last-resort drug to treat patients with multi-drug resistant infections. Finding colistin-resistant bacteria in the United States is important, as it was only last November that scientists in China first reported that the <em>mcr-1</em> gene in bacteria confers colistin resistance. Following the revelation in China, scientists across the globe began searching for other bacteria containing the <em>mcr-1</em> gene, and the bacteria have since been discovered in Europe and Canada. The <em>mcr-1</em> gene exists on a plasmid, a small piece of DNA that is not a part of a bacterium?s chromosome. Plasmids are capable of moving from one bacterium to another, spreading antibiotic resistance between bacterial species.</p>
<p>The patient with colistin-resistant <em>E. coli</em> was treated in an outpatient military treatment facility in Pennsylvania.  Biologic samples were sent to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for initial testing and then to MRSN for genetic sequencing to identify the <em>mcr-1</em> gene.</p>
<p>Our three departments take the emergence of this resistance gene very seriously.  A coordinated public health response is underway to try to prevent its spread.</p>
<p>For example, to respond to the DoD finding of <em>mcr-1</em> in a human isolate, HHS?s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working with DoD, the Pennsylvania Department of Health, local health departments, and others to identify close contacts, including household and healthcare contacts, of the Pennsylvania patient to determine whether any of them may have been at risk for transmission of the bacteria containing the <em>mcr-1</em> gene. Similarly, USDA is conducting traceback work to determine the sampled pig&#8217;s farm of origin.</p>
<p>At the same time, the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) is continuing its search for evidence of colistin-resistant bacteria in the United States. For the past 20 years, NARMS has detected emerging resistance to clinically important antibiotics. NARMS is a partnership between HHS and USDA, as well as state and local public health departments, dedicated to tracking changes in the antimicrobial susceptibility of intestinal bacteria found in ill people, in retail meats, and in food animals.</p>
<p>After the detections in China, the NARMS teams began a two-pronged approach to search for evidence of colistin-resistant bacteria caused by <em>mcr-1</em> in the United States.  First, USDA?s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientists took on a proactive study that used a modified technique to look for bacteria with the <em>mcr-1</em> gene, employing a targeted and extremely sensitive method to examine whole bacterial populations found in intestinal samples from food-producing animals.  In the still-ongoing study, USDA scientists analyzed the samples by first exposing them to colistin at a concentration that would kill sensitive bacteria and allow any bacteria carrying <em>mcr-1</em> to survive.  Out of 949 animal samples screened so far, one strain of colistin-resistant <em>E. coli</em> was found in a pig intestinal sample. The DNA sequence of this isolate revealed that the strain contained the <em>mcr-1</em> gene on a plasmid.  The scientists also determined that the <em>mcr-1</em> carrying colistin-resistant<em> E. coli</em> is resistant to other antibiotics including ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline.</p>
<p>Second, HHS? Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration used whole genome sequencing technology to search for the gene in <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>E. coli</em> and <em>Klebsiella </em>taken from human and retail meat sources. As of April 2016, more than 44,000 <em>Salmonella</em> and 9,000 <em>E. coli</em>/<em>Shigella </em>isolates from NARMS as well as the National Center for Biotechnology Information genomic database did not show the presence of the <em>mcr-1</em> gene.</p>
<p>Although the findings suggest that <em>mcr-1</em>-mediated colistin resistance might be rare, HHS and USDA remind consumers that <a href="http://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/mintemp.html">cooking all meat, poultry and fish to its proper internal temperature</a> kills bacteria, viruses and other foodborne pathogens, whether or not they are antibiotic-resistant.</p>
<p>The NARMS partners will continue to study the newly isolated <em>E. coli</em> strain to better understand the <em>mcr-1</em> gene, as well as continue to analyze the remaining food animal samples for the presence of colistin resistance.  Once USDA?s ARS completes this study, the findings could help determine any additional steps necessary to further understand the mechanisms and dissemination of <em>mcr-1</em> and associated genes.</p>
<p>Beginning in fall 2016, CDC?s Antibiotic Resistance lab network will provide the infrastructure and lab capacity for seven to eight regional labs, and labs in all states and seven major cities/territories, to detect and respond to resistant organisms recovered from human samples. State labs will be able to detect new forms of antibiotic resistance?including mutations that allow bacteria to survive the effects of the last-resort drugs like colistin?and report these findings to CDC in near real-time.  With this comprehensive lab capacity, state health labs and regional labs that are part of the network will be able to investigate emerging resistance in ways currently unavailable, generating better data for stronger infection control among patients to prevent and combat future resistance threats.</p>
<p>And consistent with the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/national_action_plan_for_combating_antibotic-resistant_bacteria.pdf">National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic Resistant Bacteria</a>, CDC, FDA, USDA, DOD and other government agencies will continue efforts to track, slow and respond to the emergence of antibiotic resistance.</p>
<p>The two detections of the <em>mcr-1</em> gene in the U.S. provide a new clue into the antibiotic resistance landscape, and it also highlights how much we still do not understand. Colistin is rarely used in human medicine compared to other antibiotics.  It is often used to treat multi-drug resistant infections and its use is increasing.  It is not used in animals in this country.  As such, the new detection underscores the urgent need for more research in this area, and that?s why the President?s 2017 budget request also calls for Congress to fund the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative at its full level, allowing our nation?s best and brightest scientists to help the NARMS partners get ahead of the fight to keep antibiotics effective and available. Earlier this month, USDA announced that it is seeking applications for $6 million in research funding to address antibiotic resistance through this program, but currently USDA must leave nine in ten applications for AFRI grants unfunded, keeping meaningful projects off the table.</p>

<p><em>All this month we will be taking a look at what a changing climate means to Agriculture. The ten regional </em><a href="http://www.climatehubs.oce.usda.gov/"><em>USDA Climate Hubs</em></a><em> were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers that are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA&#8217;s Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate.</em></p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://news.stanford.edu/2015/09/11/el-nino-qna-091115/">hopes for a drenching from El Ni?o</a>, California farmers are <a href="http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/expert_assessment/sdohomeweb.png">facing another drought year in 2016</a>.  Even after four years of the worst drought on record, California farm output was a <a href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/statistics/PDFs/2015Report.pdf">record $54 billion in 2015</a>, accounting for more than half of the nation?s fresh produce. <a href="http://pacinst.org/publication/impacts-of-californias-ongoing-drought-agriculture/">Groundwater has helped compensate</a> for California?s lack of rainfall, but <a href="http://www.water.ca.gov/groundwater/sgm/cod.cfm">groundwater overdraft</a> cannot be continued indefinitely.</p>
<p>California farmers have responded to the drought by <a href="https://watershed.ucdavis.edu/droughtimpacts">fallowing land</a>; switching to crops that yield higher value per unit of water; and switching irrigation technologies.  Almost all California cropland is irrigated, so continued improvements in irrigation efficiency are key to weathering this and future droughts.<span id="more-65048"></span></p>
<p>There are <a href="http://ascelibrary.org/doi/abs/10.1061/(ASCE)IR.1943-4774.0000538">four main types of irrigation</a>: surface (flood and furrow); sprinkler; drip (including low-volume micro-sprinkler); and subsurface.  Surface methods generally lose the most water to evaporation, and have been declining in popularity for several decades as <a href="http://aic.ucdavis.edu/publications/PPIC.pdf">efficient drip systems take their place</a>.  The drought provides more urgency for this transition, and farmers interested in switching technologies can take advantage of grants from <a href="https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/EnvironmentalStewardship/SWEEP_Info.html">SWEEP</a>, the state?s State Water Efficiency Enhancement Program.</p>
<p>However, even when using a high-efficiency system, a farmer needs to know how much water to apply in order to accurately meet crop demand.  A large percentage of California farmers make irrigation decisions based on <a href="http://www.cimis.water.ca.gov/">CIMIS,</a> the (California Irrigation Management Information System).  CIMIS uses about 200 weather stations around the state to calculate ?reference evapotranspiration?: water lost from a well-watered grass field under current local conditions. Farmers then multiply this number by a ?crop coefficient? for a rough estimate of their actual water demand.</p>
<p>Even better is to measure the actual evapotranspiration in an individual farm field ? but, until recently, that required equipment that was too costly for most producers.  A new, cheaper sensor technology called surface renewal, <a href="http://www.ars.usda.gov/research/projects/projects.htm?accn_no=425022">developed jointly</a> by ARS and UC Davis, performs real-time evapotranspiration measurements on the spot.  Results so far from California fields show that surface renewal can provide a more detailed and accurate picture of crop water demand ? potentially saving much-needed water for other uses.</p>
<p>It is unknown when California?s current drought will end, and <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/13/3931.abstract">climate change will likely increase the risk of severe droughts in the future</a>.  Efficient irrigation technologies will become ever more important to help California maintain its role as the nation?s number one agricultural producer.</p>

<p><em>All this month we will be taking a look at what a changing climate means to Agriculture. The ten regional </em><a href="http://www.climatehubs.oce.usda.gov/"><em>USDA Climate Hubs</em></a><em> were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers who are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA&#8217;s Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate.</em></p>
<p>Honey bee health and climate change would both rank high on anyone?s list of hot topics in agriculture these days.</p>
<p>Lewis H. Ziska, an Agricultural Research Service (ARS) plant physiologist, with what is part of the Northeast Climate Hub in Beltsville, Maryland, knows this. He also knows that any study involving both honey bees and climate change should be carefully conducted and cautiously interpreted.  Ziska has been studying the effects of climate change on plants since 1988. He has been focusing on how rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) levels accompanying climate change are affecting a wide range of plants?from important food crops to noxious weeds.<span id="more-65022"></span></p>
<p>So Ziska and his colleagues were extremely thorough in their analysis of how rising CO<sub>2</sub> levels are affecting the pollen of Canada goldenrod (<em>Solidago Canadensis</em>), the most widespread source of fall protein for honey bees. It?s considered crucial in helping honey bees survive through winter.</p>
<p>To confirm the honey bees? fall feeding habits, the researchers went out to a field in the Berkshires, identified the number of goldenrod plants there, and then counted honey bee ?visits? to each plant. To mimic the effects of climate change over the past 150 years, they exposed goldenrod growing in chambers of undisturbed soil in Texas to graduated levels of CO<sub>2</sub>. To get an historical perspective, they analyzed goldenrod pollen from across the United States collected as far back as 1842 and stored at the National Museum of Natural History.</p>
<p>Study results showed that the pollen protein levels have declined by up to a third since the 1850s, when atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels began rising, and that the most serious declines have occurred since 1960, when CO<sub>2</sub> levels began rising dramatically. It was the first study to document the effects of rising CO<sub>2</sub> levels on honey bee diets. The results appeared in <a href="http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/283/1828/20160414"><em>Proceedings of the Royal Society B</em></a>.</p>
<p>Scientists say the results are consistent with the rules of basic plant biology. Plants exposed to higher CO<sub>2</sub> levels produce more starch and sugar but less protein. Scientists have consistently found the same trend?diminished protein content with increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels?in studies of human food crops. In fact, it is precisely the trend in food crops that prompted Ziska to conduct his study.</p>
<p>But there could be a silver lining. The results may help scientists address increases in mortality rates in managed honey bee colonies by coming up with ways to improve diets and ensure that the bees get sufficient protein in the fall to survive through winter. Ziska also is working with other scientists on ways to adapt food crops, such as wheat and rice, to climate change by using traditional breeding techniques to tap into the genes that make their wild, weedy relatives more adaptable to rising CO<sub>2 </sub>levels.</p>
<p>?We have a lot of work ahead of us, but I think people are more aware of the challenges being presented by climate change, and that?s an important step,? he said.</p>

<p><em>All this month we will be taking a look at what a changing climate means to Agriculture. The ten regional </em><a href="http://www.climatehubs.oce.usda.gov/"><em>USDA Climate Hubs</em></a><em> were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers that are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA&#8217;s Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate.</em></p>
<p>The Southern Great Plains has historically posed a challenge to farming and ranching.  Extended drought, late season freezes and excessive rainfall are facts of life in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas.  With continued climate change, the likelihood is growing that extreme weather conditions will have even more of an effect on the country?s ability to produce food and fiber as we move into the future.  It?s paramount the nation?s farmers and ranchers are given tools to develop strategies to help weather the storms and maintain the productivity and profitability necessary to stay on the land.</p>
<p>The USDA Southern Plains Climate Hub (Hub), along with USDA?s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Redlands Community College, the region?s Agricultural Universities and other partners have been working to develop best management practices designed to help ag producers adapt to intense weather events through improving soil health.  This includes the establishment of demonstration farms that implement soil health practices such as no-till, cover cropping and better pasture management.  As a result of conducting field days and soil health seminars associated with these demonstration efforts, the Hub and its partners are providing real world examples of how implementing these soil health practices can help agriculture ?harden? itself to extreme drought, volatile temperature swings and heavy rain events.<span id="more-64965"></span></p>
<p>In February of 2016, the Southern Plains Hub in partnership with Redlands Community College (RCC) in El Reno, Oklahoma, held its first Central Oklahoma Soil Health field day at the RCC Darlington Agriculture Center.  More than 100 agriculture producers, students and agriculture professionals heard nationally-recognized speakers discuss the importance of improving soil health to both maintain productivity and improve profits.  Tours were conducted of tests plots where experts from NRCS and the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation discussed different farming practices and their ability to help producers retain moisture and control erosion.  A second seminar in March drew the same interest as was in February.  The outgrowth is partnerships are under discussion for implementation in West Texas and Southwest Oklahoma.  Other efforts are underway in all three of the southern plains states, as well as potential partnerships with the regions various Native American tribes.</p>
<p>Through these efforts, the Hub and its partners hope to dramatically increase the number of no-till crop production acres, cover crop acres and pasture acres utilizing soil health principles in the region.  These practices can help increase farmers? and ranchers? soil health and organic matter, thereby increasing the water holding capacity of their grounds.  They also can greatly reduce soil erosion, reduce fuel use, sequester carbon in the soil and improve fertilizer efficiency?all efforts that not only help ?harden? agriculture to extreme weather, but helps fight climate change while protecting our water.</p>
<p>There are no silver bullets in the battle against climate change.  However, by helping farmers and ranchers improve the health of the soil, the Southern Plains Climate Hub believes it is at least giving them a fighting chance to deal with the extreme conditions climate change exacerbates.</p>

<p><em>All this month we will be taking a look at what a changing climate means to Agriculture. The ten regional <a href="http://www.climatehubs.oce.usda.gov/">USDA Climate Hubs</a> were established to synthesize and translate climate science and research into easily understood products and tools that land managers can use to make climate-informed decisions. The Hubs work at the regional level with an extensive network of trusted USDA agency partners, technical service providers, University collaborators, and private sector advisers to ensure they have the information they need to respond to producers that are dealing with the effects of a variable climate. USDA&#8217;s Climate Hubs are part of our broad commitment to developing the next generation of climate solutions, so that our agricultural leaders have the modern technologies and tools they need to adapt and succeed in the face of a changing climate.</em><span id="more-64917"></span></p>
<p>In the Northeast and Midwest U.S., a changing climate is expected to continue impacting agriculture for the foreseeable future.  From Minnesota to Maine and Maryland to Missouri, increasingly severe weather, variable temperatures, and at times droughty soil conditions are exacerbating the existing challenge of managing productive lands without degrading natural resources.  To help farmers adjust their practices or even transform their operations (?adapt?) to meet these challenges, the USDA Northeast, Midwest, and Northern Forests Climate Hubs collaborated to develop ?Adaptation Resources for Agriculture,? a compilation of information about climate change considerations and responses.  Authors from the U.S. Forest Service, Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the Agricultural Research Service teamed up to review climate change literature and develop easy to understand guidance for on-farm decision-making.</p>
<p>?Adaptation Resources for Agriculture? includes a regional summary of climate change effects on agriculture, a compilation of adaptation strategies and approaches, and a workbook to identify farm specific response options leading to flexible adaptive actions.  The workbook is intended for use in a small workshop setting to enable farmer engagement in understanding how climate change impacts their enterprise and natural resources and how to respond for the benefit of current and future generations.</p>
<p>Based upon the <a href="http://forestadaptation.org/framework-components/forest-adaptation-resources">?Forest Adaptation Resources?</a> developed by the U.S. Forest Service and Northern Institute of Applied Climate Science in 2012 and Adaptation Workbook <a href="http://forestadaptation.org/demonstration-projects">demonstrations</a> completed by hundreds of users across a wide variety of projects on public and private lands, ?Adaptation Resources for Agriculture? has been developed specifically to meet the unique needs of agricultural producers.  Many climate science concepts apply to both agriculture and forestry anywhere in the nation, including sustaining the fundamental functions of soil and water resources, reducing the impacts of biological stressors or extreme weather, and managing the enterprise as part of a larger landscape.</p>
<p>In each region, agricultural producers will experience different types and degrees of climate change effects depending on their site specific conditions and capacity to cope with impacts or to take advantage of opportunities.   For example, the Midwest and the Northeast have experienced a significant increase in extreme precipitation since the mid-1900?s resulting in delayed planting, increased soil erosion, loss of nutrients, flood damage, and resulting increases in expenses or decrease in yields.  Three examples of typical farms in the region highlighted in the publication: corn and soybean production in Iowa; beef grazing in Missouri; and confined dairy in Pennsylvania, demonstrate how an adaptation perspective helps farmers overcome ever increasing challenges of climate change, as well as take advantage of possible opportunities.</p>
<p>The publication is intended to serve as a template for other regions to create adaptation strategies and approaches relevant to their expected climate change conditions and typical agricultural commodities.  It is currently under review and scheduled for public release later this year.   Several workshops are planned to introduce ?Adaptation Resources for Agriculture? to educators, conservationists and producers, including a session at the Soil and Water Conservation Society annual conference in Louisville, KY in July and the National Small Farms Conference in Virginia in September.</p>
