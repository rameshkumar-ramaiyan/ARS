#USDA-ARS Umbraco Project Radiator

This site provisions a Virtual Performance Center (VPC) for this task order. The VPC is a secure central repository of project information to allow USDA Umbraco participants to access all Technik tools, metrics, schedules, reviews, templates, training, and guidance. The VPC provides performance transparency using real-time reporting; dashboards; and management tools to simplify surveillance, monitor performance, and seek opportunities for continuous improvement. Using our VPC, Task Leads and the PM monitor performance metrics, reallocate resources, and make adjustments as necessary to ensure timely and cost-accurate performance.

## A quick project overview

Provide a short description of the project's goals and a bit of background. Any links that you frequently access are also good to include up at the top as well, for easy access. Everyone loves easy access.

## Code promotion workflow

The workflow below outlines the development process.

**New Issues** All new tasks are recorded as new issues. We conduct a weekly triage meeting to review and prioritize new tasks. Anyone from the team can create an Issue at any time and know that, through this process, it will be visible to everyone. 

**Backlog** This Pipeline is a prioritized backlog of items ready for development. The Backlog is used heavily during sprint planning meetings: the higher an issue is on this list, the higher the priority. All use cases and requirements associated with the tasks are maintained in the Issue comments. 

**In Progress** Each Issue in this pipeline is assigned to a team member responsible for its completion. If a team member decides to take on a task, she or he simply self-assigns the Issue and moves it to the In Progress column, instantly communicating to the rest of the team that the task is underway. 

**Review/QA** We use the Review/QA column for Issues that are open to the team for review and testing. Usually this means the code is deployed into our Staging environment. 

**Done** Issues in this pipeline need no further work and are ready to be closed. All objectives and key metrics associated with the Issue are appended prior to closing. 

## Product Development Milestones

We use the GitHub native Milestones feature to break up the product backlog into manageable chunks. We then use an easy filter by milestones feature on the ZenHub Boards to create snapshots of our product roadmap. Each product development Sprint has a Milestone associated. During the Sprint planning meeting, we create the new Milestone and assign to it tasks from the 'backlog' Pipeline that make up the Sprint. 

## Keeping a Record of Sprints

We implement weekly Sprints.  A special Issue associated with a milestone is created per Sprint, identified with the label ‘Sprint Goal’ that details all the information around the Sprint. 

## Environments

Information for the dev, staging and live environments is provided as a wiki page.
